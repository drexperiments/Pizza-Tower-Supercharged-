# pizza tower: Supercharged
Have You Ever Wanted Pizza Tower but you wanted literally every mod that you could think of shoved in while I have the solution for you Pizza Tower supercharged is a pizza Tower mod forked from oven injector when you load your own mods and it adds new characters new game modes and even new levels it's still in work in progress so just wait 

# OvenInjector

A mod loader for Pizza Tower, built upon a [decompilation](https://github.com/loypoll/OpenTower) of Pizza Tower v1.1.0 (Noise Update).

Meant to be simple to use for both players and modders alike.
